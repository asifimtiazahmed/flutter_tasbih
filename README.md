# ultimate_tasbih_app

The Ultimate Tasbih App tries to bring together all the best aspects of the variety of tasbih apps out there, and consolidate them onto one app.
Including its own features! 

## Getting Started

I will later add the animations and other details here. 

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

## Logic for storage management
The idea here is to have all the data loaded from firebase once the app loads. These will be stored in
data_manager file.
For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
